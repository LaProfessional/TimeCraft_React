# ⏰ TimeCraft (React)

**TimeCraft** is a simple web-based daily planner built for educational purposes. The project is implemented using **React** to practice working with:

- CRUD operations  
- RESTful APIs  
- Authentication (bcrypt + JWT)  
- A modern frontend stack  

This project is a React-based version of [TimeCraft_JS](https://github.com/LaProfessional/TimeCraft_JS), originally written in vanilla JavaScript. The main goal is to compare architectural approaches, usability, and scalability between React and plain JS applications.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📅 Add, delete, and edit tasks (CRUD)  
- 🧾 Store data using an API  
- 🔐 Registration and login using `bcrypt` and `JWT`  
- 🧠 React hooks for state management  
- ⚛️ Structured application with a component-based architecture

## 🧱 Project Architecture

The `src/` directory includes:

- `components/` — Reusable UI components  
- `pages/` — Pages (e.g., Planner, Login)  
- `hooks/` — Custom React hooks  
- `utils/` — Utility functions  
- `assets/` — Styles, icons, and other resources  
- `App.jsx` — Main application component  
- `main.jsx` — Application entry point  

**Technologies Used:**

- React (v18+)  
- React Router DOM
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- bcrypt + JWT (backend integration)  
- CRA
- ESLint + Prettier (for code quality and formatting)
